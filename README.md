This repository contains code and data for reproducing the results presented in the paper:

Baumgartner, M. T. & Zapata, O. P. (2024). Taylor's power law for freshwater fishes: functional traits beyond statistical inevitability. Journal of Animal Ecology.

To reproduce the analyses, we recommend copying the files from this repository to a particular folder in your computer and downloading the files '1873_2_RivFishTIME_SurveyTable.csv' and '1873_2_RivFishTIME_TimeseriesTable.csv' directly from the RivFishTIME database (<https://doi.org/10.25829/idiv.1873-10-4000>) because of their sizes. Then, put them all in the same file, and run scripts in order from 00_ to 06_. Please send a message to <matheustbs@gmail.com> for any questions or comments.
